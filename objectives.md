### Mohammed Amin ~
As this is a learning experience, 
some of the technologies that I'd like to learn/incorporate into this project 
and that I feel would be very useful in the long run are the following:  

####TDD  
In the implementation of this project, I feel that it would be highly valuable to follow the TDD style  

Follow [MVP](https://github.com/konmik/konmik.github.io/wiki/Introduction-to-Model-View-Presenter-on-Android) pattern and incorporate new Android techniques such as [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html)  
  
[Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/)  
[Retrofit 2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) OR [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley)  
[RxJava / RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)  
[Realm](https://realm.io/) / [Firebase?](https://firebase.google.com/)  
####Testing
UI Testing: [Espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/)  
Unit Testing: [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) | [JUnit4 / Mockito](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html)  

###Guides and Tutorials
Super amazing blog for [Retrofit 2](https://futurestud.io/blog/retrofit-getting-started-and-android-client) along with other blogs if you're interested [Android and Node.js](https://futurestud.io/#popular-blog-series) stuff  
  
My take on Retrofit summarized from the blog above: [Retrofit 101](https://gist.github.com/Arta0613/8c198421d2d2a22b80d5000e343a44f3)
